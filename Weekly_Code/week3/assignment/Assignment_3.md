#Assignment #3:

##Animation and p5##

For this week I would like you to create movement in your sketches. This is the last assignment before we work on a larger project. Up to this point we have work with basics of drawing and basics of interaction with mouse clicking. Now we will be think about how to move those objects on the canvas. There a number of ways that this can be done but we will create animations that will run themselves and some that may be controlled by the mouse.

I am leaving the concept of the assignment up to you but I would like to see inventive use of the elements that we have discussed and worked on up to this point.

You should create one more set of 5 sketches this week with animation. Please try to have some of the sketches animation when the sketch is loaded and some that will animate with a mouse click or other interaction.

This should be uploaded to Github for class on *Friday, 2/21/2018*
