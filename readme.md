## Welcome to Interactive Art ART 649/488 

This document is a brief introduction to the course and how we will work throughout the semester. This class will be an introduction to using code to create visual and sound works and we will use JavaScript to create our weekly assignments and large projects. 

**Method of approach:**

We will be meeting in person on **Fridays between 1-4:40pm at the Lions Brothers Building in Hollins Market area of Baltimore City**. There is a shuttle to this class and you will be required to attend each class at this location. Since we will only be meeting one day a week I will only allow an absence for extreme situations with the proper documentation. If any class is missed it will count as a deduction in your overall grade for the course.
